# Breaking the Monolith by using hapi 
## Background
Let me get the disclaimer out of the way: I am not an expert on Hapi
I started looking into Hapi's ability to break components out.
This is my attempt to follow other tutorials from a hello world to a true component system.
I have broken this down into the following steps

#HAPI Tutorial - Monolith - 4 - Move toward production
This part of the tutorial will move the customer plugin more toward a production plugin.
This step, 04d, will add unit testing.

* Unit Testing will use lab test framework.  Unit testin will also use labbable to manage the hapi server.
    The github project for lab is located here (https://github.com/hapijs/lab)
    The github project for labbable is located here (https://github.com/devinivy/labbable)
    
## Adding lab and labbable as development requirements

* Add lab to package.json by running ```npm install lab --save-dev```
* Add code to package.json by running ```npm install code --save-dev```
* Add labbable to package.json by running ```npm install labbable --save-dev```

## Adding test script to npm package.json

* Add the following configuration to your package.json
    This will call lab to run unit tests
    -L will run the linter to evaluate your code
    -v will turn on verbose test output
    -r tap -o stdout 
        Tells to run a tap report and send the output of tap to stdout
    -r html -o test.html
        Tells to run html report and send it to the file called test.html

```json
  "scripts": {
    "test": "lab -L -v -r tap -o stdout -r html -o test.html"
  }
```

* Change localServer.js
    Look at the copy of localServer.js in this project.  
    The logic has been changed to allow it to be used for unit testing by using labbable
    
* Add a directory called test
* Create a TestCustomer.js file in the test directory
    Look at our example TestCustomer.js in the project
    
    
* To run the unit test run the following command ```npm test```

* Tests may all pass but the lenting may fail.  
# Look at test.html 
Take a look at the lent errors on the files that have been running the the past tutorials

   * Have fun cleaning up the lenting errors until you get this
   
```
Linting Report

0 0
```

   * Look at the code coverage report.
     The report will highlight lines of code that have not been tested with your unit test.
     See how close to 100% coverage you can get
     You can add the following code to TestCustomer.js to get to 100% coverage
    
   
```javascript
    test('get customers', (done) => {

        const options = {
            method: 'GET',
            url: '/customers'
        };

        server.inject(options, (res) => {

            expect(res.statusCode).to.equal(200);
            done();
        });
    });

    test('load customer', (done) => {

        const SampleCustomer = {
            id:     126,
            first:  'David',
            middle: 'H',
            last:   'Father',
            addressLine: '9 S. Ninth Street',
            city:        'Little Rock',
            state:       'AR',
            postalCode:  '72206'
        };

        const options = {
            method: 'POST',
            url: '/customers',
            payload: SampleCustomer
        };

        server.inject(options, (res) => {

            expect(res.statusCode).to.equal(200);
            done();
        });
    });
